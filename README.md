## **_Description_**

In this website, you are able to browse the inventory of aircraft used in the US for both civiliand and military purposes. The aircraft are separated by genre (i.e. fighter/bomber/attack). After clickin on the genre page, you are taken to a list of each aircraft within that genre. You are then able to click on each individual aircraft to obtain the known or hypthesized aircraft specs. Lastly, there is a form on the aircraft page where you can update an existing airplane or create an entirely new airplane. If you don't like an existing airplane, there is also an option to delete it.

## **_How to Get Started_**

Navigate through the website by clicking on the buttons provided within each genre. Navigate to the "about" link in the header for more information.
